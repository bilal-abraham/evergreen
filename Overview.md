# The Evergreen Cemetery 
Beaumont, Texas
## Finding the End of Life Story in an African American Community
### Welcome to the Evergreen Project. 
Evergreen Cemetery was established in 1912 but was forgotten and neglected over the years. It was identified as an abandoned cemetery by Sandra Wilturner and two other members of First Full Gospel Baptist Church in 1999. Wilturner remains diligent with managing upkeep, improvements, and events to support the cause.
Lillie Samuels completed the first-edition of the Evergreen Cemetery in Beaumont, Texas in 2009. The book is located in the Hillsborough County Reginal Library in Tampa, Florida, Genealogy and History section. It was dedicated to Wilturner with a goal to make it easier to obtain financial support and guidance from the national, state, and county cemetery community. The first-edition included 125 death certificates that documented deceased buried at Evergreen Cemetery. The book also featured an article about the 370th Infantry, Company A, in World War I that was an African-American Regiment with the first black commanding officers. Pvt. George Shaw was a soldier in the 370th Infantry, his remains are buried at Evergreen Cemetery. We do not have a death certificate for Sgt. George Shaw included in either edition because he died in action November 3, 1918 in France. Military documents on Fold3.com verify George Shaw's death and his ranking as Sargent at the time of his death. These documents are included in the second-edition. As a results of the first-edition Sandra Wilturner speaks of many doors opening for Evergreen Cemetery that continues today. Between the first-edition and completing the second-edition significant updates were shared with Wilturner.

This second edition is the culmination of continuous research since the first-edition. The original goal was to find up to 800 deceased but research continued after reaching that goal. We decided to temporarily discontinue research to develop this second-edition at 1,081. We are of the opinion there are others buried at the cemetery beyond our stopping point but that conclusions can be made with this group. Data was compiled from death certificates located on FamilySearch.org.
