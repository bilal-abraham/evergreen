# The Evergreen Cemetery 
Beaumont Texas
## Finding the End of Life Story in an African American Community
### Welcome to the Evergreen Project. 
Evergreen Cemetery was established in 1912 but was forgotten and neglected over the years. It was identified as an abandoned cemetery when Sandra Wilturner and two other members of First Full Gospel Baptist Church discovered the cemetery in 1999 and remains diligent today with managing upkeep, improvements, and events to support the cause.
The first edition of the Evergreen Cemetery in Beaumont, Texas project is located in the Hillsborough County Reginal Library in Tampa, Florida in the Genealogy and History section. The book was completed in 2009 and dedicated to Wilturner with a goal to make it easier to obtain financial support and guidance from national, state, and county cemetery community. The first-edition included death certificates of 125 people buried at Evergreen Cemetery. The book also featured an article about the 370th Infantry, Company A, in World War I that was the first African-American Regiment with the first black commanding officers. Pvt. George Shaw was a soldier in the 370th Infantry and is burried at Evergreen Cemetery. There was no death certificate included in the first-edition because he died in action November 3, 1918. Military documents on Fold3.com revealed George Shaw was a Sargent at the time of his death. Some documents are included in the second-edition.  As a results of the first-edition Sandra Wilturner speaks of many doors opening for Evergreen Cemetery that continues today. Between the first and second edition many significant updates were shared with Wilturner.

This second edition is the culmination of continuous research since the first-edition. The original goal was to find up to 800 deceased but we decided to discontinue this edition at 1,081. Others are believed to be buried at the cemetery beyond our stopping point but we believe conclusions can be made with this group.
